# RubyTapas #534 - Two Factor Authentication Demo Application

This demo shows how to implement the Time-based One-time Password algorithm is an open standard that computes a one-time password that changes over time given a shared secret key.

It is a standard Rails 5 application generated by running `rails new`, adding Devise,
and then working with:

- [devise-two-factor](https://github.com/tinfoil/devise-two-factor)
- [rqrcode-rails3](https://github.com/samvincent/rqrcode-rails3), which despite its name works just fine in the latest Rails 5.
