# RubyTapas #534 - Two Factor Authentication Demo Application

## Important Security Notice

**WARNING!** This demo application is an instructional example intended to demonstrate adding two factor authentication to
a Rails application. It is not production code and should not
just be copied and pasted into your production apps without understanding. The author also has not audited the implementation
for all security issues.

## Demo Setup

Everything you need to access the demo is setup by the `bin/setup` script.

```bash
bundle && bin/setup
```

It will set a randomly generated OTP encryption key in the .env file,
and generate an enrolled user. Follow the instructions in the last
